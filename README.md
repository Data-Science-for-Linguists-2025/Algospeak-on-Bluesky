# Algospeak on Bluesky
A final project by DS4LING Spring 2025 by Sara Rosenau

## Aims
What do we talk about when we talk about *algospeak*? Algospeak is the language people use to circumvent algorithims on social media sites (see "unalive" instead of "kill/die"). What happens when we use them on a non-algorithmic social media platform like Bluesky? Are we using such terms earnestly? Are we disparaging them? And why would we do either thing?

This is an investigation as part of my larger research on the functions of algospeak on and off-line.
